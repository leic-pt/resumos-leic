This is a fork of [gatsby-plugin-use-dark-mode](https://github.com/wKovacs64/gatsby-plugin-use-dark-mode)
for Resumos LEIC, since we have two different requirements:

- Our theme style picker has 3 options instead of 2 (light, dark **and** system).
- We don't want to change the user's preferences when the site loads.
